# Configuring notification emails

Advanced Forms' email notification system makes it possible to configure any number of notification emails to any number
of recipients on form submission. Each notification email can be configured to send to a different set of recipients and
each email can be set up to send different fields (or not fields at all) from the submission.

## How to configure a notification email

First, navigate to the form you want to configure a notification email for and click the **Notifications** tab under the
**Form Settings** metabox:
